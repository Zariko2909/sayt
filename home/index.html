    <h2>Advanced Text Styling Practice Examples</h2>
    <p>
      Below are various advanced text styling examples that you can practice:
    </p>
    <div class="dec">
      <h3>Example 1: Text Decoration and Transformations</h3>
      <p class="test">This text is underlined and uppercase.</p>
      <p class="test1">this text has a line through it and is lowercase.</p>
      <p class="test2">This text has an overline and is capitalized.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ind">
      <h3>
        Example 2: Text Indentation and Spacing
      </h3>
      <p>
        This paragraph has a text-indent of 50 pixels, making the first line indented. Additionally, there is increased word spacing and letter spacing applied to this text, creating a more spread-out appearance. Observe how the spacing affects the readability and appearance of the paragraph.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" >
      <h3>Example 3: Line Height and White Space Handling</h3>
      <p>
        This paragraph has a line height that is double the normal line height. This creates more space between the lines, making the text easier to read. Additionally, this text is set to handle white space by preventing wrapping.
This text is set to nowrap, meaning it will stay on a single line and not wrap to the next line, even if it overflows the container.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="first">
      <h3>
        Example 4: Pseudo-elements (first-line, first-letter)
      </h3>
      <p>
        This paragraph uses the `first-line` and `first-letter` pseudo-elements. The first line of this paragraph is styled differently from the rest of the text, and the first letter is enlarged and bolded to create a drop cap effect.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="shad">
      <h3>
        Example 5: Opacity and Text Shadow
      </h3>
      <p class="test">
        This text is partially transparent, with an opacity level set to 0.5, making it appear faded.
</p>
<p class="test1">This text has a shadow effect applied, giving it a 3D appearance.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div  class="footer">
